# Misc Python
Miscellaneous Python Scripts and Experiments

## What is this?

This is a place for me to add small Python Experiments and tiny scripts
that aren't large enough for their own repository.

## Interested?

Feel free to do with this as you like, but please credit me if you use
more than a few lines. If your project is public I'd appreciate knowing
where it's used or how you like it. Mainly out of curiosity than
anything else.

If you want to contribute fixes or something, feel free to fork and PR,
just leave a comment in the PR and comment your code.
